# Plank Keyboard Layout

The Plank is a ortolinear Keyboard created by [olkb](https://olkb.com/planck), that can be configured via the [Quantum Mechanical Keyboard
Firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware). 
The files of this repo are my current keyboard layout configuration.

This layout is initially copied from [Noah Fredericks great layout](https://github.com/noahfrederick/dots/tree/master/planck) and will be modiefied by my needs.
